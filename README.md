### About Me

I'm someone who believes tech should make life simpler, not more stressful. Whether it's taming a misbehaving Windows update, setting up remote desktop access for your grandmaâ€™s printer, or figuring out why your chatbot says weird thingsâ€”Iâ€™m here to help it all crumble the right way.

Iâ€™ve worked across three countries, supporting thousands of users with software, devices, and infrastructure. My roles at Medtronic, Sky UK, and Nuance (via Sykes) shaped my approach: keep it human, stay calm, and talk tech in a way that makes sense.

These days, Iâ€™m learning how to train AI systems instead of just usersâ€”working with ChatGPT customization, chatbot creation, and prompt design. Itâ€™s new tech, but Iâ€™m diving in with curiosity and code, documenting my progress on GitHub: github.com/TheMelodyOfCode.

Backed by certifications from Cisco and Microsoft, and fluent in the tools of the modern stackâ€”from React to Firebaseâ€”I support people, not just problems.
