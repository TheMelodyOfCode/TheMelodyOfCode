### About Me

I believe tech should simplify lifeâ€”not add more stress. Whether itâ€™s calming down a rogue Windows update, connecting grandmaâ€™s printer via remote desktop, or figuring out why your chatbot insists on speaking in riddlesâ€”Iâ€™m here to help things crumble the right way.

Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve supported thousands of users across Germany, Scotland, and England. From high-stakes medical devices at Medtronic, to internal IT support at Sky UK, to helping users navigate speech and PDF software at Nuanceâ€”Iâ€™ve learned to stay calm, speak human, and solve problems efficiently.

Today, Iâ€™m expanding into the world of AI systemsâ€”exploring ChatGPT customization, building smart chatbots, and learning the art of prompt engineering. Iâ€™m documenting the journey and sharing what I learn on GitHub.

What drives me isnâ€™t just fixing bugs or writing clean codeâ€”itâ€™s empowering people to trust technology again.
