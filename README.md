## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

**"The cookie will crumble the way it's supposed to crumble."**

I'm an IT support specialist and AI tech explorer who believes technology should feel intuitive, not overwhelming. Whether itâ€™s troubleshooting a voice recognition bug, guiding users through remote desktop setups, or experimenting with smart chatbotsâ€”I help people stay calm while their systems stay online.

With over a decade of support experience across Germany, Scotland, and England, Iâ€™ve worked in both frontline and backoffice roles for companies like Sky UK, Medtronic, Nuance, and Vodafone. From medical devices to telecom infrastructure, I bring structured problem-solving and people-focused communication.

My background covers operating system support (Windows/macOS/Linux), remote tools, mobile troubleshooting, and specialty software like Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Omnipage, and Power PDF.

Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into AI workflowsâ€”customizing ChatGPT, creating website chatbot agents, and learning prompt engineering. I'm also exploring Python and neural networks to evolve with the tech. You can follow my journey here:
